HaxeMaps
========

Haxemaps is an library written in Haxe language designed to accelerate the implementation of a map application. The proposed framework allows to arbitrary combine vector and raster (e.g. tile-layer, WMS image) layers or overlays. On top of that it is possible to easily extend the basic functionality and implement custom static as well as interactive layers.
